Upload this plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.\r\n1. Activate this plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.\r\n1. The configuration of this Plugin is Automattic!\r\n= Plugin Uninstallation =\r\n1. Disable it from Menu Plugins of Admin Dashboard Control Panel.\r\n2. Delete it from Menu Plugins of Admin Dashboard Control Panel.\r\n= Troubleshooting =\r\nIf all else fails and your site is broken remove it directly via ftp on your host space.\r\n== Frequently Asked Questions ==\r\nThe HTML5 Shiv enables use of HTML5 sectioning elements in legacy Internet Explorer and provides basic HTML5 styling for Internet Explorer 6-9, Safari 4.x (and iPhone 3.x), and Firefox 3.x.\r\n\r\nIE7.js is a JavaScript library to make Microsoft Internet Explorer behave like a standards-compliant browser. It fixes many HTML and CSS issues and makes transparent PNG work correctly under IE5 and IE6.\r\n\r\nThe term shiv originates from John Resig, who was thought to have used the word for its slang meaning, a sharp object used as a knife-like weapon, intended for Internet Explorer. Truth be known, John probably intended to use the word shim, which in computing means an application compatibility workaround. Rather than correct his mispelling, most developers familiar with Internet Explorer appreciated the visual imagery. And that, kids, is etymology.\r\n\r\nPIE (Progressive Internet Explorer) makes Internet Explorer 6-9 capable of rendering several of the most useful CSS3 decoration features.\r\n\r\nCSS Level 3 brings with it some incredibly powerful styling features. Rounded corners, soft drop shadows, gradient fills, and so on. These are the kinds of elements our designer friends love to use because they make for attractive sites, but are difficult and time-consuming to implement, involving complex sprite images, extra non-semantic markup, large JavaScript? libraries, and other lovely hacks.\r\n\r\nCSS3 promises to do away with all that! But as we all know, due to Internet Explorer's lack of support for any of these features, we must be patient and refrain from using them, and make do with the same old tedious techniques for the foreseeable future.\r\n== Screenshots ==\r\n1.

For bug's please refer to [sLa NGjI's GitHub ](//github.com/slangji/) bug's report support\r\n1. For tickets please refer to [sLa NGjI's Contact](//slangji.wordpress.com/contact/) tickets form support\r\n\r\n* Please note that:\r\n * We are not interested in reviews on our plugins and themes.\r\n * Do not write anything like that!\r\n * We are not interested in stars on our plugins and themes.\r\n * Do not make any in that sections!\r\n\r\nGenerally we're not interested to be informed if you like our plugins and themes, or if you use them successfully through the instruments of the wordpress.org forums!\r\n\r\nRemember to keep proper behavior on the wordpress.org forum, under the rules, respect all their moderators, and its users: this team do not supporting anymore wordpress.org forum, and the possibility that some of us then reply or write on wordpress.org forum, will be very low!\r\n\r\n... to be continued ? ...\r\n",
