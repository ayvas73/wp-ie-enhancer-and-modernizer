== Frequently Asked Questions ==
The HTML5 Shiv enables use of HTML5 sectioning elements in legacy Internet Explorer and provides basic HTML5 styling for Internet Explorer 6-9, Safari 4.x (and iPhone 3.x), and Firefox 3.x.</li>
</ul>

<p>IE7.js is a JavaScript library to make Microsoft Internet Explorer behave like a standards-compliant browser. It fixes many HTML and CSS issues and makes transparent PNG work correctly under IE5 and IE6.</p>

<p>The term shiv originates from John Resig, who was thought to have used the word for its slang meaning, a sharp object used as a knife-like weapon, intended for Internet Explorer. Truth be known, John probably intended to use the word shim, which in computing means an application compatibility workaround. Rather than correct his mispelling, most developers familiar with Internet Explorer appreciated the visual imagery. And that, kids, is etymology.</p>

<p>PIE (Progressive Internet Explorer) makes Internet Explorer 6-9 capable of rendering several of the most useful CSS3 decoration features.</p>

<p>CSS Level 3 brings with it some incredibly powerful styling features. Rounded corners, soft drop shadows, gradient fills, and so on. These are the kinds of elements our designer friends love to use because they make for attractive sites, but are difficult and time-consuming to implement, involving complex sprite images, extra non-semantic markup, large JavaScript? libraries, and other lovely hacks.</p>

<p>CSS3 promises to do away with all that! But as we all know, due to Internet Explorer's lack of support for any of these features, we must be patient and refrain from using them, and make do with the same old tedious techniques for the foreseeable future.

<p>== Disclaimer ==</p>

<p><code>sLa NGjI's Team do not provide support on wordpress.org forum!</code></p>

<p>Dear user of plugins or themes:</p>

<p><code>sLa NGjI’s Team has started adventure on
wordpress.org forum since 2007: 7 years ago!</code></p>

<p>Everything was very different from today: the plugins and themes developed by us were much less, and also the users who used it.</p>

<p>The traffic generated by users of the wordpress.org forum has increased exponentially, and in the same way also the requests for assistance have increased exponentially.</p>

<p>In the near future this increase will be even more pronounced, as a result of the great success of WordPress.</p>

<p>By contrast, both the posts and threads definable "requests" and those definable "trash" are very difficult to finding and follow: the time necessary for this purpose, now, longer a nightmare that one added value service, real.</p>

<p>With the passage of time, the problems of this type of assistance have been deemed ineffective by more and more developers excellent, while the tools available for this workload considered insufficient or inadequate to many of them.</p>

<p>Many of these developers have already abandoned this platform of assistance by providing other methods of customer care.</p>

<p>Our team has tried to respond to all for seven long years, and maintained the support forums for plugins and themes developed always clean, neat, and clear.</p>

<p>Failing to provide a service that gives us satisfaction, through the instruments of wordpress.org forum, as of today August 15, 2014 we abandon the active support with this type of structure, started since August 7, 2007 to try to give one type of service more personalized, and targeted, to requests of users.</p>

<li><p>For tickets please refer to <a href="//slangji.wordpress.com/contact/">sLa NGjI's Contact</a> tickets form support</p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Please note that:

<ul>
<li>We are not interested in reviews on our plugins and themes.</li>
<li>Do not write anything like that!</li>
<li>We are not interested in stars on our plugins and themes.</li>
<li>Do not make any in that sections!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally we're not interested to be informed if you like our plugins and themes, or if you use them successfully through the instruments of the wordpress.org forums!</p>

<p>Remember to keep proper behavior on the wordpress.org forum, under the rules, respect all their moderators, and its users: this team do not supporting anymore wordpress.org forum, and the possibility that some of us then reply or write on wordpress.org forum, will be very low!</p>
